# cmod-toksys

This repository contains the machine specific information required for 
General Atomic's TokSys code to be used with the Alcator C-Mod tokamak.  

Initially it contains only the information required to build vacuum objects that match EFIT data. 
Other inputs for toksys should really be gathered directly from C-Mod MDSplus trees.
